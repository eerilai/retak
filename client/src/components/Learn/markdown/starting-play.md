Players alternate turns throughout the game.

Each player must make a play on their turn - there is no option to pass. Tak is played with only orthogonal movement and connection; squares are not connected diagonally, and diagonal movement is not possible.

On each player's first turn, they place one of their opponent's stones flat on any empty square of the board, as a show of good faith. Past the first turn, only stones a player controls may be played.
