Each turn you may do one of two things: place a stone, or move stones you control.

#### Placing Stones

On your turn, you can opt to place a stone from your reserve onto any empty square on the board. There are three stone types that can be placed:  

*Flat Stone* — The basic stone, laid flat on it’s face. This is what you use to build your road.

*Standing Stone*​ — The basic stone, but stood up on edge. Also known as a wall. This piece does not count as part of a road, and other stones cannot stack on top of it.

*Capstone* — The most powerful stone. It counts, like a flat stone, as part of your road. Other stones cannot stack on top of it. The capstone also has the ability to move by itself onto a standing stone and flatten the standing stone into a flat stone. You can flatten both your opponent's standing stones and your own in this way.

#### Moving Stones

The other option on your turn is to move stones or stacks of stones that you control. If your stone is on top of a stack, you control that entire stack. All three stone types (flat, standing, and cap) can be moved, and moving is the only way to create stacks. Stacks do not have a height limitation.

When moving stacks of stones, you can not move more stones than the size of the edge of the board; this is called the hand size. On a 5×5 board this means you can not pick up more than 5 stones from a stack. On a 6×6 board the hand size is 6, and so on.

There are several simple steps to executing a stack move:
Pick up any number of stones, up to the hand size for the board you're playing on. Do not change the order of these stones. Move in a straight line in the direction of your choice – no diagonals and no changing direction.

You must drop at least one stone from the bottom of the stack in your hand on each square you move over. You may not jump over walls or capstones. The capstone may drop onto a standing stone at the end of a move to flatten it, but it must be the only piece moved onto it.
