There are three possible ways to win in Tak:

*A Winning Road* — Connect two opposite sides of the board with a road. A road can include a capstone, but can't include standing stones.

*Double Win* — If a player makes a move that creates a winning road for both players, the active player is the winner. This situation arises rarely, but it's not impossible.

*Flat Win* — If either player runs out of pieces, or if the board is covered, then the player with the most flat stones wins.
